                <span>Explicit is better than implicit</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Simple is better than complex</span>

            <li>
                <span>Complex is better than complicated</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Flat is better than nested</span>

            <li>
                <span>Sparse is better than dense</span>

            <li>
                <span>Readability counts</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Although practicality beats purity</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Errors should never pass silently</span>

            <li>
                <span>Unless explicitly silenced.</span>

            <li>
                <span>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>There should be one-- and prefarably only one --obvious way to do it.</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Now is better than never.</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Although never is often better that *right* now.</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</span>
            </li>
